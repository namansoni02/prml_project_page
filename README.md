📝 Abstract
Given an image query, the goal is to retrieve relevant images using HoG and CNN feature extraction, exploring classification and clustering techniques. Image Retrieval using CIFAR-10 aims to develop a content-based image retrieval (CBIR) system that leverages Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HoG) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for feature extraction. HoG, a traditional yet effective method, captures the shape and appearance of objects by computing gradient directions across small image cells, providing robust descriptors for object detection. Complementing this, CNNs extract hierarchical and complex features from images, enabling superior representation of textures, edges, and object parts.

✨ Features
Content-based image retrieval using CIFAR-10 dataset

Dual feature extraction techniques:

Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HoG)

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

Classification and clustering for image retrieval

Interactive web interface for query submission

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Project
bash
python main.py
📊 Dataset
The project uses the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes:

Airplane

Automobile

Bird

Cat

Deer

Dog

Frog

Horse

Ship

Truck

Each class contains 6,000 images with 50,000 training and 10,000 test images.
